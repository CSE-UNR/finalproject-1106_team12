Main Algorithm:
Display the menu that gives the options to load a new image, display a current image, edit the current image, and exit the program. 
If the user chooses to load a new image it should read the contents from any size of the input file of any size.
If the user chooses to display the image the program will display the image.
If the user chooses to edit the current image it should display a menu to choose from Crop, Dim, and Brighten. And then perform the selected option. 
If the user chooses to exit, the program will close.


Functions:
Load Image:
* Open the file specified by the user input filename

* Close the File
* Return the Image
Open Current Image:
* Open the current file
* Read the current File
* Close the current File
* Return the current File
Crop Image:
* Extract the current image and get the specified region of the image(given by the x, y, width and height)

Dim Image:
* Iterate through the list of 2D brightness values
* Decrease the brightness levels a given amount
* Return the new image




Brighten Image:
* Iterate through the list of 2D brightness values
* Increase the brightness levels a given amount
